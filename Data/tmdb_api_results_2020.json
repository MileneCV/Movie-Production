It's a question that haunts Walt (Jim Tavar\u00e9), the owner of Essential Music, an indie record store in the heart of Silver Lake. Walt's all too aware of how his punk-rock glory days are fast fading in the rear-view - even as he can't help recounting war stories to his much younger employees: Lysette (Kate Dalton), who has to contend with a parade of customers convinced she's the Record Store Girl of their dreams; Chris (Derek James Elstro), the lead singer of Troubled Meats, a band poised for takeoff, and maybe not just in Chris' mind; and well-meaning music nut Duane (Adam Weber), who's a little too fluent in Rock Critic for his own good. With a love of all types of music evident in every shot, WARMED-OVER KRAUTROCK is a comedy for anyone who's ever spent too much time obsessing over playlists - and for anyone who's ever been driven crazy by that type of person, too.", "popularity": 0.701, "poster_path": "/e9sZQ7s4rwG0ItjLLPKnXXvVVY2.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2021-03-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [{"english_name": "English", "iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Warmed-Over Krautrock", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "certification": ""}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/l8IwMFQxOxwzV0cdyem7pnQY2SM.jpg", "belongs_to_collection": null, "budget": 0, "genres": [{"id": 878, "name": "Science Fiction"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "homepage": "http://www.emmageddon.movie", "id": 755522, "imdb_id": "tt4777218", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Emmageddon", "overview": "Struggling screenwriter Emily, who works in a gelato shop, writes a screenplay about struggling screenwriter Emma, who works in a coffee shop, and is secretly a superheroine named Emmageddon.", "popularity": 1.224, "poster_path": "/vp6J0lhAvRLuCRf1GeBhX25Njny.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2020-08-15", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"english_name": "English", "iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Emmageddon", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/9lropttr13U34csVkseFGZY98Kl.jpg", "belongs_to_collection": null, "budget": 0, "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Adventure"}], "homepage": "", "id": 346687, "imdb_id": "tt4779326", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Water Man", "overview": "Hoping to save his sick mother, a boy named Gunner and his friend Jo venture into the remote Wild Horse forest to search for a mythical figure who possesses the secret to immortality.
